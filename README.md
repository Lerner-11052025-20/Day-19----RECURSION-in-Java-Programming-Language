# Day-19----RECURSION-in-Java-Programming-Language
📁 Day-19: Recursion in Java 🧠 Welcome to Day-19 of my DSA with Java learning journey! Today’s focus is on Recursion – one of the most fundamental yet powerful concepts in computer science. This repository contains beginner to intermediate level problems solved using recursion.
📌 What is Recursion?
Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solving smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function is a function that calls itself with modified parameters.

Key Components of a Recursive Function:

Base Case – defines the stopping condition.

Recursive Case – the part where the function calls itself.
